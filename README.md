## Xibis: A Galactic Voyage

Help aliens find a home with these outer-world adventures! 

In this single-player escapade, users must employ logic and empathy to successfully escort their group of aliens to their new home. Reminiscent graphics and lovable characters will allow players to escape into the narrative, while discovering more than they ever anticipated. 

Xibis: A Galactic Voyage was built by a small team of full stack developers with a desire to recreate the magic of 90's computer games. The journey of your aliens - the Xibis - guides the user through a series of mini-logic games, with each successful completion bringing us closer to our goal: finding a new home for our alien friends!

### Technology

While working on this project, the team implemented technologies like Cloud Firestore and Redux to seamlessly integrate game state and user data. We furthered our understanding of front-end development with SASS, CSS animations, and React--along with exploring SVG rendering and pixel-art creation--and enjoyed applying these tools to the unfamiliar field of game design.
